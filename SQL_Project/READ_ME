This is a short weekend project I did using SQL and Excel on suicide rates. The data was from the world health orgnaization. All data sets
,SQL code and outputs will be attached along with the final report. 

Alternatively if you prefer to see my solution to some hackerank/leetcode style questions in SQL, I have also attached a file containg that.
