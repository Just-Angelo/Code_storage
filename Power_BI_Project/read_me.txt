This is a slide pack I made using publicly available data mainly from the ABS. It mainly consists of data visualisations I generated using Power BI.
I have also attached a PowerBI dashboard using a generated data set. 

Note: Although I have worked on cost of living during my time working for the state government, the views expressed here do not in any way represent the view of the government or any
previous employers.
