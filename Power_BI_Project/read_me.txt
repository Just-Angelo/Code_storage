This is a slide pack I made using publicly available data mainly from the ABS. It mainly consists of data visualisations I generated using Power BI.
I can also make dashboards in Power BI but since I already did that for tableau, I figured I'd have a slide pack instead.

Note: Although I have worked on cost of living during my time working for the state government, the views expressed here do not in any way represent the view of the government or any
previous employers.
